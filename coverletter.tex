\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am writing to pursue a possible software engineering position with \companyname. I am interested in any position that will put my software engineering skills to good use.

Having recently completed my Bachelor's degree at UMSL, I have experience writing, testing and debugging code in a number of languages (such as Java, Javascript and C/C++), have developed for a number of operating systems including Windows, Linux, Unix and IOS, and have used many tools such as those offered by Eclipse, Git, and Violet UML. I enjoyed using and sharpening these skills, as well as working as part of Agile development teams, and believe this opportunity will allow me to continue doing so in a professional capacity.

\lettersection{Why \companyname?}
As a recent computer science graduate with a passion for software development, \companyname, seems like a fantastic fit for me. Ideally, my perfect job would allow me to work alongside industry professionals every day, work on new and interesting technologies, and help provide real services to real people. For this reason I find myself being drawn to \companyname, and I would love to contribute to the success of this company with my own set of skills!

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I am a skilled developer with many talents that would be useful for this position, and a strong willingness to learn besides.
Attached is my resume. Please call me at (206) 697-0392 with any questions you may have about me or my abilities. I look forward to your response!
