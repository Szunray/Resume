\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am writing to pursue a possible software engineering position with \companyname. I am interested in any position that will put my software engineering skills to good use.

Having recently completed my Bachelor's degree at UMSL, I have experience writing and testing code in a number of languages such as C/C++, Java and Javascript. I have developed in a number of environments, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS. I have used many tools, such as those offered by Eclipse, and have an understanding of relational databases (and the languages that govern them, such as SQL). I enjoyed using and sharpening these skills, as well as working as part of Agile development teams, and believe this opportunity will allow me to continue doing so in a professional capacity.

\lettersection{Why \companyname?}
As a recent computer science graduate with a passion for technology, \companyname, seems like a perfect fit for me. The company's history as being an industry leader and household name appeal to me greatly, as does the prospect of working on a service that millions of people, including myself, use every single day. 

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I am a skilled developer eager with many talents that would be useful for this position, and a strong willingness to learn besides.
Attached is my resume. Please call me at (206) 697-0392 with any questions you may have about me or my abilities. I look forward to your response!
